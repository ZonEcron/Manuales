## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Device

The ZonEcrón® Invisible—when we say ZonEcrón®, imagine neon lights and fireworks, etc.—was designed as a replacement for conventional systems typically mounted next to or on top of the first and last jump. These conventional systems often obstruct the guide or dog's run to some degree.

With this premise in mind, and driven by our nature to minimize effort, we incorporated a series of conditions similar to those of the original ZonEcrón®. This means easy installation, no cables, etc., while leveraging our experience from developing the original ZonEcrón®. We also added requirements such as maintaining consistent detection height and ensuring everything is installed within the jump wings.

Finally, the ZonEcrón® Invisible (from now on simply ZonEcrón®) was created to improve the timing systems currently available by offering greater simplicity, ease of use, and safety for both dogs and guides.

### 1.3 Compare Us

We believe we’ve developed a product with unique features. We haven’t found another product that combines all the characteristics of the ZonEcrón®, which we won’t repeat here.

When we realized we needed a competition timer, we searched thoroughly and found other products with the same goal. However, none of them met all our requirements, so we decided to create our own.

If you have specific needs that the ZonEcrón® does not fulfill, there are other similar products. We encourage you to search, compare, and if you find… well, that’s it… a questioning mind is an awake mind.

## 2 Usage

### 2.1 Assembly and Power-On

The ZonEcrón® is installed within the structure of a jump, and since it cannot be seen… we’ve called it invisible… I think I’ll have to talk to the marketing team because they don’t seem to be putting much effort into this. For each jump, one wing will contain the infrared emitters (the top cap has 1 LED, and the decorative covers are white), while the other wing will house the infrared receivers (the top cap has 2 LEDs, and the decorative covers are black):

|                  Emitter                    |                   Receiver                    |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ![Emitter](../images/invisible/emitter.png) | ![Receiver](../images/invisible/receiver.png) |

So, it’s really “almost invisible,” but pay attention—not to place two emitter wings on the same jump because, logically, it won’t work (and it wouldn’t be the first time this happens). The sharp-eyed among you might also notice that two receiver wings on the same jump won’t work either.

Have we been clear enough? Just in case, for each jump, you’ll need one wing with emitters and one wing with receivers.

Once the wings are positioned opposite each other, all that’s left is to turn them on. The switch and the battery charging port are located on the bottom of the wing inside the horizontal profile. They are protected by a sliding cover that closes with a spring. Slide the cover and set the switch to the "on" position (I).

The LEDs (1 or 2 depending on the type) will light up instantly. For the receiver, the LEDs will remain steady for 5 seconds while radio communication is established. The blue LEDs will stay on to indicate that the ZonEcrón® is… well, let’s see who says it… very good! They stay on to indicate that the ZonEcrón® is powered on. I’ll need to have a word with the R&D team because they seem to be following the same path as marketing.

### 2.2 Alignment and Detection

Once the emitter and receiver are facing each other and powered on, six infrared beams will be created between the six emitters and the six receivers to detect the passage of any dog at any height:

![Beams](../images/invisible/beams.png)

The white LED on the receiver wing will turn off if the alignment is correct and will light up to indicate that one of the beams has been interrupted. The LED will stay lit for a minimum of 0.5 seconds, or if the interruption lasts longer, it will remain lit for that duration.

If any of these barriers are interrupted, the timer will start or stop. If, due to the placement of the bar, an emitter-receiver pair is permanently blocked, after 5 seconds, that pair will be ignored, and the white LED will turn off. Multiple pairs can be blocked simultaneously if additional bars are needed below the jump bar, for example, to prevent the dog from passing under a jump during training. The only pair that cannot be permanently blocked is the top one.

![Blocked Beam](../images/invisible/beamsPole.png)

The standard use is for a jump, but it can also be used for timing sequences by positioning the wings without a bar, for instance, at the exit of a tunnel. Be cautious when placing emitters and receivers too close to each other or parallel to walls, as the emitter's power is sufficient to reflect off nearby objects or bypass a hand if the two are too close. We recommend a minimum distance of 1m. The maximum distance depends on ambient light levels, ranging from 2 meters in full daylight to 20m in dark conditions with artificial lighting.

### 2.3 Infrared Self-Interference

Due to the power of the infrared beams designed to operate in full sunlight, it’s possible for a receiver to pick up signals from two emitters. This effect is more pronounced in low-light conditions or enclosed spaces.

The most noticeable symptom is that the white LED on a receiver constantly turns on and off, potentially starting and stopping the timer even when no beam has been interrupted.

This can happen if the wings are misaligned. For example:

![Self-Interference](../images/invisible/selfInterference.png)

In this case, Receiver 1 (R1) receives infrared signals from Emitter 1 (E1) and Emitter 2 (E2) and becomes confused.

To avoid this, position the two receivers in opposite directions so they can only receive signals from one emitter. In the previous example, you would do the following:

### 2.4 Radio Communication

Radio communication is automatically established between the cells and any additional accessories from the ZonEcrón® family. This communication operates within the Wi-Fi frequency range and may be affected in environments with many active Wi-Fi networks.

Each receiver contains an internal antenna to establish this communication. The theoretical maximum range is 80m in open areas. We’ve tested a range of 200m in a residential park with several Wi-Fi networks nearby without communication issues. For optimal performance, we recommend not exceeding 40m in a standard-sized course.

### 2.5 Screen Display

Unlike the original ZonEcrón®, the invisible system does not include an integrated display. To view the times, you’ll need a ZonEcrón® scoreboard or a ZonEcrón® dongle connected to a computer with our application. Please refer to the manuals for those elements for more information.

### 2.6 Power and Charging

The four devices (two transmitters and two receivers) have an internal rechargeable lithium battery, so there is no need to use power or communication cables during operation.

Battery levels can be checked using the ZonEcron app or the ZonEcron display, depending on the viewing system you are using. We recommend reviewing the specific manuals for additional details. Additionally, the devices indicate the battery level through the blue LED's blinking pattern:
- **Battery above 30%**: Solid blue LED.
- **Battery between 30% and 15%**: Slow blinking blue LED.
- **Battery below 15%**: Fast blinking blue LED.

This charge indicator is **approximate**, as it is based on the battery voltage measurement, which does not always accurately reflect the remaining charge. Therefore, it is normal for the charge percentage to drop quickly from 100% to 90%, remain stable between 90% and 10%, and then rapidly decrease from 10% to 0%. We recommend not draining the battery excessively to avoid unpleasant surprises, like "oh no" moments.

The devices feature a USB-C port on the bottom near the power switch. To recharge the batteries, turn off the devices and connect a standard USB cable to a USB charger. Due to the physical design of USB connectors, it is not possible to connect them incorrectly, ensuring even the clumsiest users are safe.

**WARNING: EXTREME TEMPERATURES.**

Lithium batteries have an operating and charging range between 5°C and 50°C. Outside this range, the power they can supply may fluctuate, causing erratic behavior of the timer. The charge duration will also be shorter.

We strongly advise against using or charging the batteries outside this range, especially if they are too cold, as this will drastically shorten their lifespan or render them useless. If the day has been extremely cold or hot, turn off the devices and leave them in a reasonably temperate location. Wait an hour for them to adjust to the temperature before charging.

**WARNING: DO NOT CHARGE DEVICES UNSUPERVISED.**

No battery-operated device should be charged without supervision. While it is common to leave phones charging overnight without issues, this does not mean that problems are impossible. Not long ago, a major company experienced issues with phone batteries overheating during charging, leading to explosions. For your safety and that of others, do not leave devices charging unattended. You don’t need to stare at them for 4 hours, but staying nearby is recommended. If this is not possible, it’s best to disconnect them and resume charging later. These batteries have no memory effect and can be charged in intervals without issues.

**WARNING: INSPECT AFTER IMPACT.**

At some point, it is likely that a dog may collide with the wing where the ZonEcron© is located. The design aims to make the device as robust as possible and to securely fasten the internal components, but in such cases, it is mandatory to inspect the device thoroughly. If any damage is observed, if there are loose parts inside, or if it overheats during charging, immediately turn off and disconnect the device. Place it in a safe area away from flammable materials and contact us to explore possible solutions.

That said, the ZonEcron© features an electronic circuit that controls battery charging and discharging. It prevents the batteries from overcharging or over-discharging. The 0% battery indication is the minimum recommended level, at which point the ZonEcron© should be recharged. However, the device will remain on, squeezing the last bit of battery power until the protection circuit shuts it off. This can be useful in emergencies but should not become a habit as it will negatively impact the battery's lifespan.

Finally, the common advice to fully discharge batteries before recharging applies to older Ni-Cd batteries. For these "modern" (not so new anymore) lithium batteries, **it is better not to discharge them completely** (in fact, it’s harmful). It is much better to recharge them when they are partially charged. Even charging them in intervals does not negatively affect their performance.

### 2.7 Battery Life

A new device has a battery life exceeding 35 hours, which is more than sufficient for a two-day competition. This battery life will decrease over time due to the natural life cycle of lithium batteries.

Ambient temperature can also negatively affect battery life:
- During use, colder temperatures reduce battery life. Using the devices below 0°C is not recommended.
- During charging, it is advisable to charge the batteries at moderate temperatures between 10°C and 30°C to ensure a proper and complete charge.

To maximize battery life, the following strategies have been implemented:
- When the timer is running, the screen brightness is reduced since the most important information is the elapsed time. When the timer stops, the screen brightness is maximized.
- Once the timer has stopped, after 30 seconds of inactivity, the screen brightness is further reduced, and after another 30 seconds, the screen turns off, only lighting up for 1 second every 5 seconds.

---

### 2.8 Sun and Rain

The original ZonEcron has been designed to work perfectly outdoors, under the sun or in the rain.
- Its distinctive white color was specifically chosen to prevent overheating under the sun.
- Its design allows for use in the rain, provided it is kept upright with the connectors facing down to prevent water ingress through the openings.

---

### 2.9 Storage

When storing the ZonEcron, consider both humidity and battery care:
- As mentioned earlier, the ZonEcron **is rainproof but not humidity-proof**. If it remains damp for several days, moisture will gradually seep into the casing and can irreparably damage the electronic components. Therefore, if used in the rain, it should be left in a dry environment for a day to completely eliminate any residual moisture before storing.
- Regarding the battery, if you plan not to use the ZonEcron© for an extended period, **it is best to leave the batteries at half charge** to maximize their lifespan. Storing lithium batteries fully charged or fully discharged for long periods can significantly degrade their performance.

### 3 Epilogue

Enjoy your time with your dogs, and don’t let frustration take over by comparing your times to others (although healthy competition makes things more fun). You only need to compete against yourself.

This timer is designed to make your competitions easier to manage, both when using the timer and during height changes.

We hope you get the most out of the ZonEcron©, and remember, no silly mistakes out of laziness... Give it your all, come on!
