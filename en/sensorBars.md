## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Equipment

The ZonEcrón® bars, and when we say ZonEcrón®, we want you to imagine neon lights and fireworks in the background. As we were saying, the ZonEcrón® bars were conceived after the invisible system, due to updated regulations that allow the course to start or end without a jump.

Just like with the invisible system, given our natural inclination toward minimal effort, we included the same requirements: easy installation, no cables, no need to adjust detection height, and ensuring that everything fits inside a tube to minimize obstructions.

Finally, the ZonEcrón® bars (from now on simply ZonEcrón®) were created to improve the timing systems currently available, offering greater ease of use and safety for dogs and handlers.

### 1.2 Key Features

- Compact design: all components are inside the bar (tube).
- Quick to set up: as fast as assembling a jump.
- Suitable for outdoor use: designed for use in sunlight and rain.
- Rechargeable: via USB, with over 30 hours of battery life.
- Safe: harmless signals (infrared and Wi-Fi) with no sharp edges.
- Wireless: no cables are used except for battery charging.
- Long communication range: tested up to 200 m, recommended up to 40 m.
- Six sensors that eliminate the need to adjust cells for height changes.

### 1.3 Compare Us

We believe we have developed a product that is unique in its performance. We haven’t found any other product that combines all the features of ZonEcrón®—which we won’t repeat here.

When we needed a competition timer, we searched extensively and carefully. We found other products that had the same goal, but none met all our requirements. That’s why we decided to create it ourselves.

If you have a specific need that ZonEcrón® doesn’t meet, there are similar products. We encourage you to search, compare, and if you find… well, you know… a questioning mind is an awakened mind.

## 2 Usage

### 2.1 Assembly and Power On

All the electronics, battery, antenna, etc., are installed inside the bar (tube), and since you can't see them... we called them bars. I'll need to talk to marketing because it doesn't seem like they're trying very hard. In each pair, one bar will contain the infrared emitters (the top has 1 LED and white trim), while the other bar will contain the infrared receivers (the top has 2 LEDs and black trim):

![Receiver and Emitter](../images/bars/bars_rec_emis.png)

Here you can see the two LEDs of the receiver at the top and the emitter opposite with white trim.

Pay attention not to pair two bars with emitters together, as obviously, they won't work (this wouldn't be the first time it happens). The more observant among you will also realize that two bars with receivers in the same pair won’t work either.

We hope this is clear enough... Just in case, for each pair, you need to place one bar with emitters and one bar with receivers.

Before placing the bars facing each other, you need to turn them on because the switch and the port for charging the battery are located at the bottom of the tube, making it impossible to turn them on or off once mounted on the base.

![USB and Switch](../images/bars/bars_usb_and_switch.png)

The LEDs (1 or 2 depending on the type) will light up instantly. In the case of the receiver, they will remain on for 5 seconds while the radio communication is established. The blue LEDs will stay on to indicate that the bar is… exactly… on. I’ll also need to talk to R&D because they seem to be following marketing's lead.

To hold the bars vertically, the alignment cylinders must be assembled onto the three-legged bases. These cylinders are attached to the base using a screw and nut that connect the two parts of the cylinder, ensuring that the longer part, meant to fit inside the tube, is positioned at the top of the base. No tools are required; hand-tightening is sufficient. Using a wrench could damage the plastic these alignment cylinders are made of:

![Base and Cylinder](../images/bars/bars_base_and_cylinder.png)

Finally, the bars must be inserted into the cylinders on the bases, ensuring the 6 emitters on one bar are properly aligned with the 6 receivers on the other bar:

### 2.2 Alignment and Detection

Once the emitter and receiver are facing each other and powered on, 6 infrared beams will form between the 6 emitters and the 6 receivers, allowing the detection of any dog's passage at any height:

![Bars](../images/bars/bars.png)

The white LED on the receiver bar will turn off if the alignment is correct and will light up to indicate that one of the beams has been interrupted. The LED will remain on for a minimum of 0.5 seconds or longer if the interruption persists. If any of these beams are interrupted, the timer will start or stop.

The normal use is before the first obstacle and after the last one in a competition course, but they can also be used to time sequences by placing the bars at the exit of a tunnel, for example. Be cautious when placing the emitter and receiver too close together or parallel to walls, as the emitter’s power is strong enough to bounce off nearby objects, and its (invisible) glow can bypass an obstacle like a hand if they are too close. We recommend a minimum operational distance of 1 m. The maximum distance depends on the amount of ambient light, ranging from 2 meters in bright sunlight to 20 meters in dark conditions with artificial lighting on the course.

### 2.3 Infrared Self-Interference

Due to the power used to operate under direct sunlight, it can happen that a receiver picks up infrared signals from two emitters. This effect is more pronounced in low-light conditions or indoor spaces.
The most noticeable symptom is the white LED on the receiver flashing on and off constantly, possibly triggering the timer to start and stop without any beam being broken.
This can occur even if the bars are more or less aligned. Example:

![Self-Interference](../images/bars/selfInterference.png)

In this case, receiver 1 (R1) receives infrared signals from both emitter 1 (E1) and emitter 2 (E2), causing interference.

To avoid this, place the two receivers facing opposite directions so they can only receive signals from a single emitter. In the above example, we will do this:

![No Self-Interference](../images/bars/noSelfInterference.png)

---

### 2.4 Radio Communication

Radio communication is automatically established between the cells and other potential accessories from the ZonEcrón® family. This communication operates within Wi-Fi frequency ranges and can be affected in environments with many Wi-Fi networks.

Each ZonEcrón® receiver has an internal antenna to establish this communication. The theoretical maximum range is 80 m in open fields. We have tested a range of 200 m in a residential park with multiple Wi-Fi networks from nearby homes, without communication failures. For optimal performance, we recommend not exceeding 40 m when used in a regulation-size course.

### 2.5 Display Visualization

Unlike the original ZonEcrón®, the invisible system does not have an integrated display. To view the times, you will need a ZonEcrón® scoreboard or a ZonEcrón® dongle (backpack) connected to a computer along with our application. Please refer to the manuals for these devices for more information.

### 2.6 Power and Charging

The four devices (two transmitters and two receivers) have an internal rechargeable lithium battery, so there is no need to use power or communication cables during operation.

Battery levels can be checked using the ZonEcron app or the ZonEcron display, depending on the viewing system you are using. We recommend reviewing the specific manuals for additional details. Additionally, the devices indicate the battery level through the blue LED's blinking pattern:
- **Battery above 30%**: Solid blue LED.
- **Battery between 30% and 15%**: Slow blinking blue LED.
- **Battery below 15%**: Fast blinking blue LED.

This charge indicator is **approximate**, as it is based on the battery voltage measurement, which does not always accurately reflect the remaining charge. Therefore, it is normal for the charge percentage to drop quickly from 100% to 90%, remain stable between 90% and 10%, and then rapidly decrease from 10% to 0%. We recommend not draining the battery excessively to avoid unpleasant surprises, like "oh no" moments.

The devices feature a USB-C port on the bottom near the power switch. To recharge the batteries, turn off the devices and connect a standard USB cable to a USB charger. Due to the physical design of USB connectors, it is not possible to connect them incorrectly, ensuring even the clumsiest users are safe.

**WARNING: EXTREME TEMPERATURES.**

Lithium batteries have an operating and charging range between 5°C and 50°C. Outside this range, the power they can supply may fluctuate, causing erratic behavior of the timer. The charge duration will also be shorter.

We strongly advise against using or charging the batteries outside this range, especially if they are too cold, as this will drastically shorten their lifespan or render them useless. If the day has been extremely cold or hot, turn off the devices and leave them in a reasonably temperate location. Wait an hour for them to adjust to the temperature before charging.

**WARNING: DO NOT CHARGE DEVICES UNSUPERVISED.**

No battery-operated device should be charged without supervision. While it is common to leave phones charging overnight without issues, this does not mean that problems are impossible. Not long ago, a major company experienced issues with phone batteries overheating during charging, leading to explosions. For your safety and that of others, do not leave devices charging unattended. You don’t need to stare at them for 4 hours, but staying nearby is recommended. If this is not possible, it’s best to disconnect them and resume charging later. These batteries have no memory effect and can be charged in intervals without issues.

**WARNING: INSPECT AFTER IMPACT.**

At some point, it is likely that a dog may collide with the wing where the ZonEcron© is located. The design aims to make the device as robust as possible and to securely fasten the internal components, but in such cases, it is mandatory to inspect the device thoroughly. If any damage is observed, if there are loose parts inside, or if it overheats during charging, immediately turn off and disconnect the device. Place it in a safe area away from flammable materials and contact us to explore possible solutions.

That said, the ZonEcron© features an electronic circuit that controls battery charging and discharging. It prevents the batteries from overcharging or over-discharging. The 0% battery indication is the minimum recommended level, at which point the ZonEcron© should be recharged. However, the device will remain on, squeezing the last bit of battery power until the protection circuit shuts it off. This can be useful in emergencies but should not become a habit as it will negatively impact the battery's lifespan.

Finally, the common advice to fully discharge batteries before recharging applies to older Ni-Cd batteries. For these "modern" (not so new anymore) lithium batteries, **it is better not to discharge them completely** (in fact, it’s harmful). It is much better to recharge them when they are partially charged. Even charging them in intervals does not negatively affect their performance.

### 2.7 Battery Life

A new device has a battery life exceeding 35 hours, which is more than sufficient for a two-day competition. This battery life will decrease over time due to the natural life cycle of lithium batteries.

Ambient temperature can also negatively affect battery life:
- During use, colder temperatures reduce battery life. Using the devices below 0°C is not recommended.
- During charging, it is advisable to charge the batteries at moderate temperatures between 10°C and 30°C to ensure a proper and complete charge.

To maximize battery life, the following strategies have been implemented:
- When the timer is running, the screen brightness is reduced since the most important information is the elapsed time. When the timer stops, the screen brightness is maximized.
- Once the timer has stopped, after 30 seconds of inactivity, the screen brightness is further reduced, and after another 30 seconds, the screen turns off, only lighting up for 1 second every 5 seconds.

---

### 2.8 Sun and Rain

The original ZonEcron has been designed to work perfectly outdoors, under the sun or in the rain.
- Its distinctive white color was specifically chosen to prevent overheating under the sun.
- Its design allows for use in the rain, provided it is kept upright with the connectors facing down to prevent water ingress through the openings.

---

### 2.9 Storage

When storing the ZonEcron, consider both humidity and battery care:
- As mentioned earlier, the ZonEcron **is rainproof but not humidity-proof**. If it remains damp for several days, moisture will gradually seep into the casing and can irreparably damage the electronic components. Therefore, if used in the rain, it should be left in a dry environment for a day to completely eliminate any residual moisture before storing.
- Regarding the battery, if you plan not to use the ZonEcron© for an extended period, **it is best to leave the batteries at half charge** to maximize their lifespan. Storing lithium batteries fully charged or fully discharged for long periods can significantly degrade their performance.

### 3 Epilogue

Enjoy your time with your dogs, and don’t let frustration take over by comparing your times to others (although healthy competition makes things more fun). You only need to compete against yourself.

This timer is designed to make your competitions easier to manage, both when using the timer and during height changes.

We hope you get the most out of the ZonEcron©, and remember, no silly mistakes out of laziness... Give it your all, come on!
